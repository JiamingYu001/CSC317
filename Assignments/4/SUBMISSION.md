## Description of implementation
[First is to working on what a calculator should looks like. For example, just open up the cell phone and see what it looks like. And then making the html and the buttons in order since when it is make with css classes, all of them are line in order. Then, implement it into the profile pages. Just add the link of the calculators. I added it into the project list so then people can scroll down and click into the calculator right there. And lastly is to writing a javascript for each numbers and operations]

## Challenges
[The real challenges is to think about how the css should be working for the calculators, for example, grid, how large it is etc. And also the javascript is also ]

## Additional features or improvements
[Can either clear the whole calculators or delete 1 number instead, do not worry about delete 1 number will make it delete everything]

## Acknowledgment of any works
[styles.css is from Assignment 3 final group decision of AI + Hand written solutions]
[script.js is used from some AI generation for me to learn since I don't know some functions, other simples are hand written]
[also some grid designs and highlight buttons desgins are from AI]
